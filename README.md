# exapunks-compiler
An attempt to define the grammar and create a compiler for the assembly-like language from the game EXAPUNKS. The idea is to create a parser in ANTLR, generate scaffolding and then create a compiler using that. I am currently using [the ANTLR lab](http://lab.antlr.org/) to experiment.

## [SPOILERS]Language specification from EXAPUNKS
The game provides [2 zines](https://exazines.mattmerr.com/) that define the language. I do NOT recommend reading these ahead of time if you are interested in playing EXAPUNKS at some point. The game does an excellent job of introducing and referring to these zines throughout, making you genuinely feel like an underground hacker.
